`I want to insert/add a line after searching a particular string or text

input:
header 1
      text1
      text2

header 2
      text4
      text5

 
Expected output
header 1
      text1
      text2
      text3 

header 2
      text4
      text5

 I have tried with ansible lineinfile, blockinfile, replace,regexp. I was able to add the required text but it is adding at the end of the file as shown below

header 1
      text1
      text2
      

header 2
      text4
      text5
 
      text3

I want it to be added exactly under header1 and after text2`
